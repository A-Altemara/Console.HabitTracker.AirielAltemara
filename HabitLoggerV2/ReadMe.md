My first time making a CRUD application with C# and SQLite.
I have VERY little experience in SQL but that did help in the few statements that had to be made.
I followed the tutorial yesterday, and remade it today by heart. (with a few peaks)

Steps to use

On starting the program, you get a main menu.
Here you can choose between different actions to add/ delete/ edit data in the database through the console.

Lessons learned and areas to improve

- It's surprisingly easy to connect a SQLite database once you get the hang of the syntax, which is great! And fun to program with.
- I should definitely have made some functions to validate integerinput and dateinput. By not doing this, there's too much repeating code. I should react immediately and not be lazy, and make a function so I don't repeat code.
- I got a better view on loops and debugging in general, sometimes the main menu repeated when I didn't want it to etc. The fixes were pretty simple, but hard to find, I used breakpoints extensively in this project, and it was really fun to use!
- Got my toes wet with DateTime objects which seems to be a category on its own as a datatype
- I used A LOT of chatgpt to correct me on syntax or give me examples of syntax, this is such a great tool and saves me a lot of time! I also learned not to try to get it to solve logic problems, it doesn't seem to do that very well.
- All in all this was quite fun to make and I learned A LOT once again!
