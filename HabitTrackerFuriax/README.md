<h1> Habit Tracker </h1>

This application is part of the csharpacademy.com console app projects. <br>
Goal of the website is to become better at C# trough building small projects. <br>
This project teaches the basic concepts of working on a project that rely on data from a database. <br>

<h2>Use:</h2>
The program is designed to track one single habit. Users can choose this habit freely, just like the units for measurement. <br>
Some examples: How much water or coffee you drink, how much km you run, etc. <br>
The program allows you to store, update and delete data.  <br>
It also give you an overview of all logged activities and all activities from the last 7 days in chronological order. <br>

<h2>Requirements:</h2>
This project came with the following requirements:<br>
- Let the user choose a habit<br>
- On startup check or create a SQLite database<br>
- Create a table in the database<br>
- Implement all CRUD methods<br>
- Close down the application when 0 is entered in the main menu<br>
- App should be crash proof by adding the adequate validation to prevent bad data<br>
- Only raw SQL statements can be used to talk to the database<br>
- Implement some kind of report method (see all activites from the last 7 days)<br>
- No need to create class files so all code is allowed to be in program.cs<br>
- Create a ReadMe file<br>

<h2>Lessons learned:</h2>
- Working with SQLite database<br>
- Performing basic CRUD commands<br>
- Learn to write basic SQL statements<br>
- Perform validation checks on all user inputs<br>
- Work with DateTime and how to format DateTime values<br>

<h2>Areas to improve:</h2>
- Become beter in SQL, had to look up nearly all of it<br>
- Become more familiar with the diffrent SQLite statements<br>
- The most difficult part for me was adding all this diffrent validationchecks, spend a couple of hours on getting it right<br>

<h2>Resources used:</h2>
- The csharpacadamy.com website<br>
- W3schools for the sql commands<br>
- StackOverflow and microsoft documentation to search for example code for various things (espacially DateTime related)<br>
- Discord channel of csharpacadamy <br>
- Some random google results<br>
