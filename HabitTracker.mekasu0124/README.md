# Introduction

Welcome To Mek's Habit Tracker. This is a console based application that assists you in tracking your current habits that was built using:
- [The C# Programming Language](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/tour-of-csharp/)
- [System.Data.SQLite](https://system.data.sqlite.org/index.html/doc/trunk/www/index.wiki)
    - This is used to store/retrieve your data locally. Your information is not stored on a cloud-based backup system, but rather on your computer itself. **__Warning:__** If you delete this application, you lose your progress!
- [ConsoleTables](https://github.com/khalidabuhakmeh/ConsoleTables)
    - This is used to assist in pretty printing your information to the console to make for easier reading.
